#Petful

##Summary

Petful is an app that allows the adoption of cats and dogs. The adoption process works strictly on a first-in, first-out basis. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the animals that have been in the shelter the longest.

Users can view the details of the cat and dog that have been in the shelter the longest.
